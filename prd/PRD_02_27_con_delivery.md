# `minicon` package, budget and delivery

Parent: [Lightweight terminal host (`minicon`)](PRD_02_23_minicon.md)

This module owns the standalone host's package identity, unwind profiles,
artifact budget, dependency-graph bans, independent CI ownership, and its
measured artifact-size history. The cross-product release contract, receipt and
sealing rules stay in
[delivery and quality](PRD_02_17_delivery_quality.md); the binary-role registry
stays in [executable family](PRD_02_02_executable_family.md).

Legend: `[x]` shipped, `[~]` partial, `[ ]` planned.

## Package identity

- [x] `minicon` is an independently owned workspace package
  (`crates/minicon`) with its own dependency graph, not a bin target of the
  workbench crate.
- [x] its resolved dependency graph contains no winit, softbuffer, Rhai,
  HTTP/TLS or script-engine dependency. `serde_json`, `hashbrown`/`RandomState`,
  ab_glyph and ttf_parser are absent from the Windows production graph and
  survive only as dev-only oracles where noted.
- [x] the platform `pty` feature declares its own `Win32_Security` dependency
  rather than relying on con's unrelated `ipc` feature to make `CreateProcessW`,
  pipes and Job APIs visible, so both the minimal capability graph and the full
  con graph are compile-owned.
- [x] the binary source lives under `src`, and all four
  public/alignment/throughput tests live under `tests`.
  The package has no `../../` source or test path back into the workbench tree,
  so Cargo ownership and physical ownership now agree.
- [x] official staging removes the obsolete experimental
  `minicon-native.exe` alias both before and after publication, alongside
  earlier retired executable names. `dist/minicon.exe` is the sole Windows
  con artifact users can accidentally select after a successful build.

## Load-time portability

The oldest Windows this product claims is **Windows Server 2016 / Windows 10
version 1607 (build 14393)**. That claim is a delivery property, not a runtime
one: the PE loader resolves every static import before `main`, so a single
import the target lacks refuses the whole program with a dialog naming a symbol
the user cannot act on. No panic hook, log or diagnostic sink can observe it,
and no other gate in this repository can see it either, because they all run on
machines new enough to satisfy the import.

- [x] no static import locks the product out of a supported Windows. ConPTY's
  three entry points (build 17763) and `SetThreadDescription` are resolved at
  run time instead.
- [x] a documented minimum version is treated as evidence, not proof.
  `SetThreadDescription` is documented as available in 1607 — which *is* Server
  2016 — and is still absent there, because 1607 implements it only in
  `KernelBase.dll` and the `kernel32` forwarder arrived in 1703. SDK header
  guards do not catch this. Only the target machine settles it.
- [x] **no Visual C++ redistributable.** The VC runtime is linked statically and
  every remaining module is a Windows component; the Universal CRT is an
  operating-system component, not a redistributable. `panic = "unwind"` is
  preserved — panic containment is not traded away for the dependency.
- [x] a custom PE entry (`/ENTRY`) obliges the program to run the CRT
  initialization the MSVC startup object would have. `__vcrt_initialize` is
  required and is not reachable through the `.CRT$XI*` table this product walks;
  omitting it links cleanly and then dies on the first panic at
  `STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN`, which reads as stack corruption and is a
  missing constructor. `__security_init_cookie` is *not* required — measured,
  not assumed: the cookie is already random without it.
- [x] a gate parses the shipped executable's import table with a pure-Rust
  parser (no `dumpbin` on PATH) and fails on any blocker symbol, or on any
  module that is neither a Server 2016 OS component nor a recorded exception.
  The exception list is empty, which is what makes a future redistributable
  dependency turn it red instead of quietly widening what a user must install.
  The gate was negative-controlled — adding an actually-imported symbol to the
  blocker list turns it red — so it is not a vacuous assertion.
- [x] `scripts/probe-imports.ps1` answers the whole question from the target
  machine in one pass, because the loader names only one missing symbol at a
  time and iterating costs a round trip per symbol, paid by whoever owns that
  machine. It parses the PE itself (the target has no Visual Studio) and
  self-tests that a nonexistent export fails to resolve and a universal one
  succeeds before printing an all-clear — an all-clear being also what a broken
  probe prints.

Verified on a user's Windows Server 2016 on 2026-08-23: all named imports
resolve, the program starts, and `--status` reports the fallback backend and a
correct half/full-width font measurement.

## 迁出后的交付差异（2026-08-23）

本子树随代码从 agenterm 迁入独立仓 `partnernetsoftware/minicon`。以下三条是**迁出时确实
发生变化**的事实，先记下来，不冒充仍然成立：

- [x] **unwind profile 的机制变了，要求没变。** `con-dev` / `con-release` / `con-release-fast`
  存在的唯一理由是 agenterm 的 workspace profile 是 `panic = "abort"`，必须逃出去。独立仓
  没有要逃的 aborting workspace，Cargo 默认就是 unwind，所以本仓改为直接在
  `[profile.release]` 里显式写 `panic = "unwind"`，不再要那层间接。下方 `con-*` 条目描述的
  是 agenterm 时期的实现。
- [ ] ~~**体积门已在本仓重建。**~~ **已撤除（2026-08-25）。** 该门自始至终只是
  **Windows 承诺**：`tests/minicon_load_portability.rs` 整个文件是 `#![cfg(windows)]`，
  其 `shipped_binary()` 硬编码 `minicon.exe`，所以它从未在 Linux 或 macOS 上运行过一次，
  而 README 把「1 MiB 上限由测试强制」与「支持 Windows、Linux、macOS」并列，
  读起来像是可执行文件的固有属性。
  单宿主六格实测（`strip=true`）：Windows arm64 677,376 / x64 731,136、
  macOS 1,413,408 / 1,455,424、**Linux 4,846,400 / 5,732,544**——
  Linux 是上限的 5 倍以上，且已确认是代码而非符号。
  一个在三个平台里两个必红的门会挡住即将开始的瘦身工作，却量不出新东西，
  所以撤门、改为在 README 直接写各平台实测字节数。
  上限若要回来，必须先明确它约束哪几个平台。
  它刻意不是警告阈值：这个数字是产品承诺，构建就应该在它上面失败。
- [~] **独立 CI 已移植，但停放中。** `ci-agenterm-con.yml` 已从 agenterm 移到本仓
  `.github/workflows/ci-minicon.yml.disabled`，`.disabled` 后缀期间不触发，一条
  `git mv` 即可启用。两处适配：`--profile con-release-fast` → `--profile release-fast`、
  去掉 `-p agenterm-con`（本仓单包）。**它从未在本仓跑过**，`build-std` 那几格尤其未验证。

## Unwind profiles and panic containment

- [x] con owns `con-dev`, `con-release-fast` and `con-release` unwind dependency
  graphs; only the resulting executable is merged into the ordinary staging
  directory, and the workbench profiles remain aborting. Staged source, merged
  profile and `dist` bytes are identical.
- [x] this exists because native callbacks must not unwind across FFI while
  panics must still be contained: an earlier aborting artifact could not satisfy
  the claimed containment contract, since Cargo test used unwind while every
  delivery profile inherited `panic = "abort"`. A release-profile synthetic
  panic-containment test is part of the ordinary gate.
- [x] the official build pins `rust-src` and uses an explicit target plus a
  subprocess-scoped Rust 1.97 build-std boundary with `backtrace-trace-only`.
- [x] Windows startup enters through a con-owned loader boundary instead of
  `mainCRTStartup`. Rust executes XI/XC constructors, calls rustc's generated
  `main` through a one-instruction architecture trampoline, then executes XP/XT
  terminators; the PE loader remains the sole XL/TLS callback authority, so
  `lang_start`, panic containment, process command-line access and Rust cleanup
  stay intact. A test-only XCU constructor proves execution before Rust test
  main. ARM64 reaches final link with its `b main` trampoline; exact ARM64 link
  remains CI/native-toolchain evidence because the development workstation lacks
  ARM64 `vcruntime.lib`.

## Artifact budget

- [x] the Windows resource retains the existing icon's 16/32/64 PNG frames while
  removing redundant mip sizes: `.rsrc` fell from 90,112 to 8,704 bytes, the
  source ICO is capped at 16 KiB by the build script, and Windows shell icon
  extraction still succeeds.
- [ ] ~~Every released `minicon` artifact must be strictly below 1 MiB
  (`release_budget_bytes = 1,048,575`)~~ — **the ceiling was withdrawn on
  2026-08-25**; see the entry above. What survives it is the second half of the
  sentence, which was never platform-specific and still binds: a size statement
  is not an observed development number, and every size statement must name its
  profile **and its target**. The omission of the target is what let a Windows
  measurement stand as the product's size. At the icon reduction the LTO
  `con-release` PE measured 8,704 bytes below the historical 512 KiB target,
  while the no-LTO `con-release-fast` PE was separately 543,744 bytes and is not
  release-size evidence. After the product ceiling changed to a strict 1 MiB,
  the official custom-std unwind/trace-only `con-release` PE measured 561,152
  bytes, 487,424 bytes below that current ceiling. This recovered budget does
  not permit reverting to abort or trading away backpressure, durability or
  clean shutdown.
- [x] size claims require linked-symbol, disassembly or target-specific cold
  build evidence. An incremental 484,352-byte artifact that did not reproduce
  from the same HEAD after an explicit Windows-target package clean is recorded
  as non-evidence, and future assembly or native FFI work must start from the
  same standard rather than from mechanism preference.

## Delivery ownership

- [x] `.github/workflows/ci-minicon.yml` is the ordinary feedback owner for
  this product, independent from `.github/workflows/ci-agenterm.yml`. Both may
  reuse platform/UI-core mechanisms, but neither product can acquire a green
  status from the other's tests.
- [x] Candidate preflight requires a successful run of both workflows at the
  exact source SHA before integrated qualification and six-platform sealing. The
  rule itself is owned by
  [delivery and quality](PRD_02_17_delivery_quality.md).
- [x] Windows x86_64 runs the matching custom-std `con-release-fast` Clippy,
  unit, public GUI black-box, panic-containment and artifact build path;
  `{x86_64,aarch64} x {win,lnx,osx}` compile cells prove the product and its
  selected platform adapters remain portable.

## Machine-readable alignment

- [x] `alignment-contract.json` maps each gated con
  capability to its owning PRD, public command set and registered black-box
  evidence. `evidence-registry.json` owns those Cargo test
  identities independently from workbench qualification.
- [x] con capabilities must not be registered in
  [`prd/alignment-contract.json`](alignment-contract.json). That contract's
  evidence identifiers must exactly match the evidence emitted by the workbench
  qualification suites in `scripts/qualification-gates.json` and
  `scripts/host-native-evidence-gates.json`, and its command catalog comes from
  `dist/agenterm cli list-commands`. Registering con there would make con's
  shipped claims depend on workbench evidence and on a CLI con does not own,
  which contradicts the independence rule above.
- [x] `minicon_alignment` rejects duplicate or orphan capabilities,
  commands and evidence, missing PRD owners or registered test functions, and
  any difference between the contract command set and the running
  `minicon cli list-commands` catalog. `ci-minicon.yml` runs that gate
  explicitly under the exact unwind profile before the complete con test suite.

## Measured artifact history

Unless an entry states otherwise, each increment reports the official
Windows x86_64 `con-release-fast` PE and was accepted with the then-current
suite green: the con unit tests (73 → 90 over this history), 16 → 18 public GUI
black-box journeys, the isolated multitab control journey, Windows x64 Clippy,
and Windows aarch64 plus Linux x64 consumer compilation. Entries below record
only what each step changed.
