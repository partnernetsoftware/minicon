//! What the shipped executable demands of Windows *before* it runs.
//!
//! Every static import is resolved by the PE loader ahead of `main`. A single
//! import that the target system does not export therefore does not degrade
//! one feature — it refuses the whole program, with a dialog naming a symbol
//! the user cannot act on. That failure mode is invisible to every other gate
//! in this repository, because they all run on a machine new enough to
//! satisfy the import.
//!
//! It shipped exactly that way: `CreatePseudoConsole`, `ResizePseudoConsole`
//! and `ClosePseudoConsole` were imported statically. They arrived in Windows
//! 10 build 17763 (1809), so on Windows Server 2016 (build 14393, still in
//! support) `minicon.exe` could not start at all. The adapter now
//! resolves them through `GetProcAddress`, and this gate is what keeps them
//! resolved that way: re-adding the plain `use` is a one-line change that
//! nothing else would notice.
//!
//! Parsing uses the pure-Rust `object` crate rather than `dumpbin`, matching
//! `agenterm-abi/tests/export_exactness.rs`: one code path, no toolchain
//! binary on PATH, and a readable failure instead of parsed console text.
